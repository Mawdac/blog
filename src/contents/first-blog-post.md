This year I'm trying out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) for the first time. Advent of Code is an advent calendar for programming puzzles. It's become a very popular Christmas coding challenge for the dev community.

I'm mainly using this as my opportunity to learn [golang](https://go.dev/).

## My solutions

You can follow my solutions in my [github repo](https://github.com/Mawdac/advent-of-code/tree/main/2022)

_Note: I have no idea what I'm doing_
